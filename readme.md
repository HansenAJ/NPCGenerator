## NPC Generator - 
Application to generate randomized NPCs for encounters in fantasy RPG games.

## Problem : 
   Players are unpredicatble and will often present game runners with the need for a random non-player-character(NPC) on the fly. Perhaps they stop in to a tavern or a shop unexpectedly and you do not have this encounter planned.
   
## Solution : 
   This app provides a fast generation for non-essential NPC's so that a story teller does not have to create one from memory on the fly. Other NPC generators do exist, the difference in this one is it's capability to update. A person can add new traits of all manner to a pool for randomization, allowing them to tailor the traits of their randomly generated characters to the game's needs.

## Capabilities : 
   Users can add specific traits to any pool to be pulled at random for an NPC to be used by the story teller, names, races, genders, classes, etc etc.
   
## Future Release plans : 
   Weighted options to allow certain traits to appear more often.
   Constrained traits to that certain options will not present at the same time.(No wizards using battle axes, no 'good guys' with evil traits)
